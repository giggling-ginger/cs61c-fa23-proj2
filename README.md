# 61C Project 2: CS61Classify

So far, finished Part A. Approximately 7.5 hours, including looking through slides and discussions.

Tough but rewarding. Got a more solid understanding of RISC-V. Wrote some Python unit tests. 

Not sure whether I would continue on the rest of projects. Depends on my free time I guess... final's coming.

感觉还挺有趣的。如果以前考研时候，有写这些作业就好了。当时考过pat，408的ds感觉切西瓜一样简单。不过机组 os本来也学得不错，可能学不学的吧，网络实在提不起记忆的兴趣，就算了。

又在惆怅过去啦。现在也来得及啦。
